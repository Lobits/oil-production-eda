# Oil Production Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores oil production data to understand production patterns, variability, and trends over time using Python.

## Project Structure
- `analysis.ipynb` – Main exploratory data analysis notebook
- `src/` – Python scripts for data inspection and visualisation
- `data/` – Raw production dataset
- `outputs/` – Generated summaries and plots

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- Oil production values cluster around specific ranges rather than being evenly distributed.
- Monthly aggregation reveals variability and periods of higher and lower production.
- A small number of higher-production observations appear as outliers in the distribution.

## Outputs
- Production distribution histogram
- Total monthly production line plot
- Descriptive statistics summaries

## Next Steps
This project may be extended with further analysis or modelling in future iterations.
